# How to contribute?

### You can contribute by:

- Adding a new topic
- Adding a sub topic under a already existing topic
- Suggesting correction in any instructions / resources


If you want to contribute from the above mentioned list then you must follow the following standards. It will help us to review and understand the topic more easily.

#### Add a new topic

- **Step 1**: Add a folder with the name of your topic. For example if you want to add `Java` as a new topic. Then you must create a new folder named **Java** inside the root of this repository.

```
each-one-teach-one
    ├── Existing_topic_1
    ├── Existing_topic_2
    ├── How-TO-CONTRIBUTE.md
    ├── Java           <----- New topic
    ├── LICENSE
    └── README.md
```

- **Step 2**: Add a **README.md** file. This is the starting point for any topics. Here add some initial comments and start added resources in the README.md


```
each-one-teach-one
    ├── Existing_topic_1
    ├── Existing_topic_2
    ├── How-TO-CONTRIBUTE.md
    ├── Java           <----- New topic
    │   └── README.md  <----- Add README.md here
    ├── LICENSE
    └── README.md
```

- **Step 3**: Please structure the readme file like the following:<br>
    - Add topic name in the readme with Heading 1. 
    - Add a short comment about the topic.
    - Add a content/topics section where you will list all the subtopics. 
    - Then for each subtopic add resources links.
    - If you think that any subtopic is very big or has a lot of resources then we would suggest you to share them in anoter markdown file with the topic name on it and link it to the main README.md file.

    For example: You think that the topic OOP(Object Oriented Programming) has a lot of resources so you can structure it like below:

```
each-one-teach-one
    ├── Existing_topic_1
    ├── Existing_topic_2
    ├── How-TO-CONTRIBUTE.md
    ├── Java                                    <----- New topic
    │   ├── Object-oriented-programming.md      <----- Sub topic
    │   └── README.md                           <----- Add README.md here
    ├── LICENSE
    └── README.md
```

- **Step 4**: If you have to add any image then we suggest you to add them under your topic folder in a `images` folder like below:

```
each-one-teach-one
    ├── Existing_topic_1
    ├── Existing_topic_2
    ├── How-TO-CONTRIBUTE.md
    ├── Java                                    <----- New topic
    │   ├── images                              <----- Images
    │   ├── Object-oriented-programming.md      <----- Sub topic
    │   └── README.md                           <----- Add README.md here
    ├── LICENSE
    └── README.md
```
